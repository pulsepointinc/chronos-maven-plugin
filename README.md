# chronos-maven-plugin #

Maven plugin for interacting with [Chronos](http://mesos.github.io/chronos/).

Heavily inspired by [marathon-maven-plugin](https://github.com/holidaycheck/marathon-maven-plugin). It similarly processes json, but deploys to Chronos.

For goals, config, and usage, see

    mvn com.pulsepoint:chronos-maven-plugin:help -Ddetail=true
